## What is this Modpack?

This modpack is a private modpack between I (Noelle) and friends. In order to make mod distribution easier,
this modpack is created to aid with that goal. Pastelpink is centralized around exploration, thus
the inclusion of many world generation and exploration focused mods.

This modpack runs [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en/) on 1.20.6

## Installation

Pastelpink is distributed here on GitHub, under the "Releases" section. Download the modpack listed in the downloads section
and install it into either [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) or the [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app).

Further instructions can be found in the [documentation](https://pastelpink-modpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
