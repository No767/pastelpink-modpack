===========================
Installation (Modrinth App)
===========================

This method is the other way to install this modpack.

Prerequisites
=============

You will need to have these installed or to be able to
access these:

- `Modrinth App <https://modrinth.com/app/>`_
- Java 21 or higher (Adoptium JDK is recommended)
- Valid Minecraft Account (Java Edition)

.. note::

    If you need to install Java 21, it is recommended to use a vendor
    such as `Adoptium <https://adoptium.net/>`_ or `Amazon Corretto <https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/>`_.

    *Technically* `GraalVM <https://www.graalvm.org/>`_ works, but it has been shown to be unstable
    with Minecraft.

Step 1 - Download the required files
====================================

In order to use the modpack, we first need to download the files. The download is here:
https://github.com/No767/pastelpink-modpack/releases/latest/download/Pastelpink-0.1.0.mrpack. 
Save it into your downloads folder (or where you usually download stuff). 

If you prefer the more technical method, use the following command listed below:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -o Pastelpink.mrpack https://github.com/No767/pastelpink-modpack/releases/latest/download/Pastelpink-0.1.0.mrpack

Step 2 - Navigating to the Modrinth App
=======================================

Once you have the file, open up "Modrinth App" within your computer. It should like this:

Step 3 - Installing the modpack
===============================

On the left sidebar, you should notice a big green button with an "+" sign. That is to create
an Modrinth profile, which basically our customized instance of Minecraft. Click on the
"From File" tab (seen in the image), and click on the "Import from File" button.

Once you have it selected the modpack, the Modrinth App will automatically create the profile,
and clicking on the newly created profile pops up an menu. Within this menu, clicking "Play"
launches the instance.
