Introduction
============

Pastelpink Modpack is a private modpack designed for a group of friends, including me. This modpack is what is required to be 
installed client-side in order to play on the server. Due to the server's private nature, only select members are allowed.

Where do I start?
=================

Installing modpacks may seem daunting at first, but they are pretty simple if you use the correct tools. In order to get started,
you'll need to install an third-party launcher. The two officially tested and recommended launchers for this modpack are 
`Prism Launcher <https://prismlauncher.org/>`_ and the `Modrinth App <https://modrinth.com/app>`_. Other launchers including 
`GDLauncher <https://gdlauncher.com/>`_ and `ATLauncher <https://atlauncher.com/>`_ *may* work but there is no support given if 
you choose to use those launchers. Throughout this guide, there will be examples shown using Prism Launcher and the Modrinth App.

.. note:: 

    `Modrinth <https://modrinth.com/>`_ is the current de-facto platform to browse and download Minecraft content
    (e.g, mods, plugins, datapacks, etc). They are entirely open sourced and overtook CurseForge due to various
    internal disputes and issues (`details <https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/issues/626>`_).

    In short, Pastelpink Modpack is compiled into Modrinth modpacks (``.mrpack``), which are **not** compatible with
    CurseForge modpacks. You will probably see this platform referenced quite a bit through the documentation.

In order to get started, the following installations guides can be found below.
