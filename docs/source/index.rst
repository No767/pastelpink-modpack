Private modpack for Pastelpink Minecraft server

What is this Modpack?
---------------------

This modpack is a private modpack between I (Noelle) and friends. In order to make mod distribution easier,
this modpack is created to aid with that goal. Pastelpink is centralized around exploration, thus
the inclusion of many world generation and exploration focused mods.

This modpack runs `Quilt <https://quiltmc.org/en/>`_ on 1.20.6
